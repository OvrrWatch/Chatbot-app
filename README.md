# Idea
A design a chatbot in the web application or the mobile based app and the arrange the food and beverages based upon the attendence report fetched by accessing the user location of the registered students and asking them their preferences and automatically placing the order. Also it will act as an automated attendence system.<br />
If the location is fetched nearby chatbot will automatically send them a message if they are in or not. If answer is yes along with their location (within a given radius) attendence will be counted and that many number of orders will be placed through Zomado, Dommino's or any other vendor service.
